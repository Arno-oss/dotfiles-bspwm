Been here before
It's in my muscle memory, I'm pretty sure
I recognize you, there is something in your eyes
Won't let you get away tonight
You leave me in the dark
I'm stumbling around like I'm a question mark
Wondering if you're around to catch me if I fall
If I come crashing to the wall

Will you light me up
Jump start my heart
I need someone
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now
Some kind of hero
I can't breathe
Hoping you're here
To rescue me
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now
Some kind of hero

Been here before
It's in my muscle memory, I'm pretty sure
I've felt this energy, there's something in your touch
Something reminding me of us

Will you light me up
Jump start my heart
I need someone
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now
Some kind of hero
I can't breathe
Hoping you're here
To rescue me
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now
Some kind of hero

Some kind of hero
