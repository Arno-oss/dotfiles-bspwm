Our empty hearts and neon lights
They're playing with my mind
Gotta get out of it tonight

Oh, I wanna run off and float
And I'll tell myself it's fine to be alone
Just to find somewhere that finally feels like home
I hate all this overthinking (oh-oh-oh-oh)
The more I swim, the more I'm sinking

Take me to a world of silver
No more heartbreaks, tears, painkillers
Take me somewhere unfamiliar
Bring me back to where we started out

Get me out of now
To where we started out
Get me out of now
To where we started out

La, la, la, la, la, oh, oh
Get me out of here

Broken hearts and starting fights
Turning truths to lies
Gotta get out, stop wasting time

Yeah, I wanna run off and float
And I'll tell myself it's fine to be alone
Just to find somewhere that finally feels like home
I hate all this overthinking (oh-oh-oh-oh)
The more I swim, the more I'm sinking

Take me to a world of silver
No more heartbreaks, tears, painkillers
Take me somewhere unfamiliar
Bring me back to where we started out

Get me out of now
To where we started out
Get me out of now
To where we started out
